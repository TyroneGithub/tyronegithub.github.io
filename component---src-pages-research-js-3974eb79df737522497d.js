In most university settings especially in the Philippine context, DevOps is not usually part of the curriculum and in some cases are only introduced to learner programmers as an elective or as bonus material. We refer to these students in computing degree programs starting out in learning programming, as novice programmers. Upon graduation, these developers transition into industry roles where they are expected to be familiar with DevOps practices. In most cases, they are not prepared, and fortunately, a great number of them are given training before fully transitioning into their hired roles. In this research, we aim to investigate, understand and support Filipino Novice Programmers in enabling them to integrate DevOps in their practices as early as possible.","website":"http://comet.dlsu.edu.ph/grit/"}]')},LTVh:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.r(t);var r=a("q1tI"),n=a.n(r),i=a("7oih"),s=a("EYWl"),o=a("hlFM"),l=a("Ji2X"),c=a("5Wrh"),p=function(e){var t=e.title,a=e.abstract;e.website;return n.a.createElement(o.a,{component:"div"},n.a.createElement("h2",null,t),n.a.createElement("p",{style:{paddingTop:"24px"}},a),n.a.createElement(c.a,null,"Project Website"))},m=a("0i2k"),u=function(){return n.a.createElement(o.a,{component:"div",py:8},n.a.createElement(l.a,{maxWidth:"md",className:"hero"},n.a.createElement("h1",null,"Research"),m.map((function(e,t){var a=e.title,r=e.abstract,i=e.website;return n.a.createElement(p,{title:a,abstract:r,website:i})}))))};t.default=function(){return n.a.createElement(i.a,null,n.a.createElement(s.a,{title:"Research"}),n.a.createElement(u,null))}}}]);
